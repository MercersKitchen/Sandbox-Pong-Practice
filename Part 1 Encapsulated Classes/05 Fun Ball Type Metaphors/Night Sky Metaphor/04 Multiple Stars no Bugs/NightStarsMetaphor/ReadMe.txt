Following Algorithm tests possible x & y-values fitting into the circles of existing stars

New points are tested against existing points, not all points, especially ones not created yet

How would all points be tested against all points in a final run?

How could the points be organized to decrease the number of comparisons?
- organizing the data into another array that is grouped
- close points are compared
- points near the edge are compared a different way or another algorithm is done
