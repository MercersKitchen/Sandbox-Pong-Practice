# To Do List
- [x] Difference between a class object, an instance, and a visual object
- [x] Define Ball-class: start with primitive variables
  - [x] for example: global variables, local variables, primitive variables, variables "bigger" than primitive
  - [x] difference between Driver-Global-Variables & Class-Global-Variables
- [x] Explore Constructor-in-Driver & Constructor-encapsulated
  - [x] What is a constructor: Population, access methods to populate
  - [x] Using a Constructor to create a group of instances for one effect: fireworks for a goal (example easter egg)
  - [x] Explore Overloaded Constructors & Conceptualizing Ball Class
  - [x] Various Ways of Interpreting Object Constructors
  - [x] Encapsulating a Constructor in it's own Class ("Net Explosion")
  - [x] SOVLED URL: https://github.com/Advanced-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Pong-Hackathon-SOLVED
	- https://github.com/Advanced-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Pong-OOP-Ball-Class-Constant-Slope
  - [x] Reminder: Fireworks metaphor changes the experience of phsyics to signal the game stops and a celebration happens
- [x] Exploring some fun metaphors
  - [x] Stars: ball bounces off small stars created (i.e. like pinball)
  - [x] Night Sky Metaphor, Pong Ball may bounce off tiny stars
  - [x] Chase Metaphor for Stars in the Knight-time Sky
  - [x] Blackhole, Collapses all stars
- [ ] Creating a New Class: Pong Rackets, left and right, Pong Table, Pong Scoreboard associated with left and right paddles
  - [ ] Pong Table
  - [ ] Net's in the Table
  - [ ] Pong Paddle on the edge of the table, defending the goal and attaching
  - [ ] Shape, bounceable dimensions, separation from goal trigger
  - [ ] Paddle will not move off the table
  - [ ] Pong Rackets are just a rectangle or player ... the racket knows the score
- [ ] Communication between instances

- [ ] OPTIONAL, Advanced: ball collisions & the physics of conservation of momentum in two dimensions (is a phsysics lesson using right triangles)


### Additions to Programs
- [ ] Minim for Sound Effects and Background Music (see grade 10 program in your GitHub or see my Introductory REsponsitory)
  - https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/App-Development
- [ ] TBA

### Reminders for Introductory Objects
- [ ] Getters and Setters
- [ ] toString() methods
- [ ] Public and Private Methods, other methods
- [ ] When variables are needed by other CLASSES' Code for operation
- [ ] TBA

## Hackathons to manage learning, demonstration, and group work

### First: Overloaded Constructor, encapsulated Ball Explosion in BALL
- [x] Array can be in MAIN Program
- [x] Populated with Multiple BALL instances

### Second: Encapsulated Paddle Bounce Code in Ball-Class creating two ERRORs
- [x] Bounce limited Pong Table (height variables)
- [x] Bounce can happen in net, eventually register a score
- [x] Bounce must happen off paddles

### Third: Pong Table and Button Scaffolding, from the Paddle Class ONLY
- [x] Pong Table (features according to Case Study, traditional table only for now
- [x] Buttons from Case Study, all with hover over working
- [x] Only Quit Button will work for now
- [x] ADVANCED: Scoreboard registers ball increments

### Forth: Abstract Classes
- [ ] Include scoreboard
- [ ] Minimum: one pong ball plays from start to finish
- [ ] Goal: one match with multiple pong balls, like five different pong balls
- [ ] Easter Eggs are optional
