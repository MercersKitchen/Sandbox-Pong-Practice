# To Do List
- [x] Difference between a class object, an instance, and a visual object
- [x] Define Ball-class: start with primitive variables
  - for example: global variables, local variables, primitive variables, variables "bigger" than primitive
- [x] Explore Constructor-in-Driver & Constructor-encapsulated
  - What is a constructor: Population, access methods to populate
  - Using a Constructor to create a group of instances for one effect: fireworks for a goal (example easter egg)
  - Explore Overloaded Constructors & Conceptualizing Ball Class
  - Various Ways of Interpreting Object Constructors
  - Encapsulating a Constructor in it's own Class ("Net Explosion")
  - SOVLED URL: https://github.com/Advanced-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Pong-Hackathon-SOLVED
  - Reminder: Fireworks metaphor changes the experience of phsyics to signal the game stops and a celebration happens
- [ ] Exploring some fun metaphors
  - Stars: ball bounces off small stars created (i.e. like pinball)
  - Night Ski Metaphor
  - Chase
  - Blackhole
- [ ] Creatign a New Class: Pong Rackets, left and right
  - Shape, bouncable dimensions, separation from goal trigger
  - Pong Rackets are just a rectable or player ... the racket knows the score
- [ ] Communciation between instances

- [ ] OPTIONAL, Advanced: ball collisions & the physics of conservation of momentum in two dimensions (is a phsysics lesson using right triangles)


### Additions to Programs


### Reminders for Introductory Objects
- Getters and Setters
- toString() methods
- Public and Private Methods, other methods
- When variables are needed by other CLASSES' Code for operation
