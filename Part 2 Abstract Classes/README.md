# Abstract Pong Class Map
CS30 Daily Lessons

**To Be Incorporated into the MAIN ReadMe.md File**

Purpose: write code and variables once, then inherit

NOTE: specific code from working Pong Template is copied into the correct abstract class from inheritance
- then code is added

Reminder: abstract classes follow rules
- variables must all be the same
- variables can be manipulated in the class or overwritten
- all extended classes must have same methods

# Preparation

Abstract Class DOC Map: documenting how variables and method names cascade (values and functions can be manipulated)
- [ ] MAIN Program: same name as Folder
- [ ] SHAPE: x, y, width, height, colour, draw(), backgroundColour()
  - Circle
  - Rectangle
- [ ] CIRCLE
  - Ball: notice this is only a single object, move()
  - Fireworks: notice this array executes from inside the class, differentMove()
- [ ] RECTANGLE: colour()
  - PongTable: 
  - Paddle: movement
  - Button: hover over, menu, action
  - ScoreBoard: incrementing and display of number of ball objects that stop in the net
- [ ] BUTTON: 
  - Reset: variables set to "game start"
  - Start: move the ball
  - Quit: exit()

Questions:
- [ ] How would text be cascaded into RECTANGLE and BUTTON but not Paddle and PoneTable
