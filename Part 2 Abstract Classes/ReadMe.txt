Purpose: write code and variables once, then inherit

NOTE: specific code from working Pong Template is copied into the correct abstract class from inheritance
- then code is added

Reminder: abstract classes follow rules
- variables must all be the same
- variables can be manipulated in the class or overwritten
- all extended classes must have same methods
